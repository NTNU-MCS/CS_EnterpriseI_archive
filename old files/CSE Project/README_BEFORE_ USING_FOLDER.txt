Do not add anything to folder just refere to it from another folder with the labview to retreieve QTMdriver.vi,

Try avoiding copying HMICSEI.vi as it may result in loss of qualisys data 

When copying folder, remember to edit dll target to the folder containing the vi in use and project folder the same




=====================================
Whole folder should be deleted, 

bloated and a mess
