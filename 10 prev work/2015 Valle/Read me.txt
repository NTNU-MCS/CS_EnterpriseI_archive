Contents:
- C++ Oculus Rift software:
	- Code for running Oculus Rift application. 
		- Oculus Rift SDK, OculusRiftInAction GitHub repository and OpenCV is necessary to run the program
	* Visual Studio 2013 have been used as a compiler.
- Simulink code:
	- Offline simulation models; 
		- MATLAB and Simulink necessary to run code
	- HIL and CSE1 model; 
		- MATLAB, Simulink (+ code generation toolbox) and NI Veristand necessary to run code
	* MATLAB 2014a has been used for the code. (Matlab 2014b is not compatible for Matlab function blocks in Simulink, if they are replaced, 2014b will work!)

- NI Veristand:
	- HIL simulation project
	- CSE1 project
	- Custom devices:
		- Wl_joystick: 	Necessary for PS3 controller interface.
		- Data Input:	Oculus Rift interface
		- Oqus:		MC lab positioning system interface
	* NI Veristand 2014 and LabVIEW 2014 is necessary
	
- LabVIEW AUR lab control interface:
	- Some example virtual instrumnets (vi) are included.It is not possible to run the software with only this code. The entire AUR lab control system is needed.
		- Interface vi; Necessary for control over sample rate runs on Oculus Rift Computer.
		- HMI panel vi; Client for receiving signals and initial signal processing.
		- Oculus Rift guidance vi; Gesture based guidance algorithm as implemented in LabVIEW.
	- Entire AUR lab software with Oculus Rift Interface is included in this distrubution (Not available through DAIM)
