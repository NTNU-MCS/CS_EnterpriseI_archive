NI Veristand an LabVIEW required to run software.

Control system software is compiled in Simulink.

HIL model connects with simulation model, while CSE1 model connects with CSE1 actuators.


Run instructions:
	- Compile simulink model (.out) file control system
	- Follow instructions in lab manual
